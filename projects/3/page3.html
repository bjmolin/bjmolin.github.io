            Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist. A founder of Studio Ghibli, he has attained
            international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and creator of Japanese animated feature films, and is widely
            regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.
            <br /><br />
            Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During
            his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata.
            Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous films with Ghibli, including Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986),
            My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992). His 2001 film Spirited Away became the 
            highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and even till this day, serves
            as the second highest-grossing film to date.
            <br /><br />
            Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and
            technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship,
            and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. Miyazaki came out of retirement and announced a 
            new film in the works, which was released on December 8, 2023. The story is a representation of himself and a way to
            finally feel satisfied with himself.
