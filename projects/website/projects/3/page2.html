            Satoru Iwata was a Japanese businessman, video game programmer, video game designer, and producer. He was the fourth
            president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Nintendo from 2002 until his death in 2015. Iwata was well known for
            incorporating his humor into his Nintendo Direct videos, a series of online press conferences open to all that revealed
            upcoming Nintendo games and products outside of typical industry channels.
            <br /><br />
            Born in Sapporo, Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while
            in high school. After showing growth at HAL Laboratory, in May 2002 he became Nintendo's president. He majored in
            computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Under Iwata's direction, Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS
            and Wii game consoles, helping the company achieve financial success.  In 2013, Nintendo released the Wii U console
            as a successor to the mega-popular Wii. It was a commercial failure, pushing the company into years of losses.
            To avoid layoffs, Iwata took a 50% pay cut to help pay for employee salaries, saying a fully-staffed Nintendo would
            have a better chance of rebounding.

            Unfortunately, in July 11, 2015, Iwata passed away leaving a huge legacy behind him. Throughout his life, Iwata was
            known for unconventional ideas and changing the medium of gaming. He was seen as the embodiment of Nintendo: playful,
            quirky, humorous, and fun. Iwata's proficiency in programming led many to refer to him as a "genius" in the subject,
            with some likening him to a Japanese Bill Gates.
