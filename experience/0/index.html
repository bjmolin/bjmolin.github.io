            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">I am a recent graduate from Clemson looking for an opportunity to show my desire to work. 
                I’ve worked within customer service for various years and have done a couple internships here in SC at Milliken in Spartanburg, touching on Microsoft Development using systems such as Azure DevOps while also working in an Agile Scrum environment. 
                In addition, I have also worked with Django and used it to make an extensive application in Senior Practicum at Clemson.
